Authors: *Kenza Bouzid, Agnieszka Miszkurka, Tobias HÃ¶ppe*

Solutions for labs for ANN course at KTH. Each lab contains implementation of neural networks algorithms as well as notebooks with experiments.

## Lab1 - From Single Layer to Multi Layer Networks

### Part 1
- perceptron learning, delta rule
- Multi Layer Perceptron with generalised delta rule (backprop)

### Part 2

- Multi-layer perceptron
network for chaotic time-series prediction


## Lab2 - Radial basis functions, competitive learning and self-organisation

- Function approximation with RBF Network
- Radial Basis Function trained with competitive learing
- Self-organising maps used for data cluserisation and visualisation  

## Lab3 - Hopfield networks

- Hopfield network with Hebbian learnign  
- Experiments concerning various properties of hopfield networks such as:
  - capacity
  - convergence
  - distortion resistance
  - energy 
  - sequential vs batch update
  - sparsity of patterns

## Lab4 - Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Nets

- RBM trained with contrastive divergence
- DBN trained using greed layer-wise pretraining of RBMs
- Using RBM and DBN for classification and generating new samples with MNIST data set
